# Welcome to Ben's Blocks

### Where I break down code, one block at a time.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
    If you're lazy (like me) and don't want to read any of this (I can't blame you) head straight to the [Code](/projects)!
</Callout>

The goal of this is to equip you to build cooler stuff by reading, copying, and reverse engineering the code on here. Each project is broken down into *blocks*, and each *block* is documented in detail. Most of the code is written in Python, with some JavaScript (React) and HTML/CSS sprinkled in.

There's a "Getting Started" section that includes a guide on how to use this blog, tools and resources that I cant live without, an a contact section if you have any questions.

## Who Am I?

I'm a self-proclaimed [bushwhack developer](magic-concepts/bushwhack-development) who's also in school for an MBA and a Masters in Clinical Social Work. I hope to use my education in organizational management and clinical social work to make a difference in the field of mental healthcare. I've got a passion for building new technology. My core interest is innovation - in particular, discovering and creating new applications of Machine Learning and AI. 

Some of my recent projects include:
1. [**An AI Mental Health Screening Tool**](https://www.beneverman.com/projects/nlp-cdst)
2. [**A Textbook to Flashcard Converter**](https://www.beneverman.com/projects/nlp-flashcards)
3. [**A Document Summarizer**](https://www.beneverman.com/projects/docworks)

Head on to the 'Getting Started' section to learn more about how to use this blog.
