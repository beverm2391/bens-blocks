The goal of this is to **showcase my work** and **equip you to build cooler stuff** by reading, copying, and reverse engineering the code. I've also got *code blocks*, which are like mini tutorials on various topics. I'll be adding more as I go.

There's a "Getting Started" section that includes a guide on how to use this blog, tools and resources that I cant live without, an a contact section if you have any questions.
