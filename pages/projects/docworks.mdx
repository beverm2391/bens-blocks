## Overview
Docworks uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI to extract key information from documents, journals, and textbooks. It can summarize, auto-generate review materials, and create flashcards.

## Problem
As a full-time graduate student and avid reader, I often find myself overwhelmed by the amount of information that I need to retain. I wanted to create a tool to help me extract key information from documents and organize it in a way that would be easy to review and recall.

## Solution
Use NLP to iterate over a document in chunks and perform summarization, information extraction, or some other task on that chunk.

## Demo
