# Building an AI to Take My Open-Notes Quizzes

## A case study in using machine learning to automate my schoolwork

<Callout>
    I got permission from my professor (who's also my program director) to do this. Thanks Dr. Nandan!

## Why do this?

At the end of the day, this is an experiment in *pushing the boundaries of what's possible*. Remember, learning development should always be done within some **meaningful context**, one that's interesting and relevant - else, coding will be a chore. This project was a fun way to practice my Python skills, and almost all of this can serve as a useful prerequisite to larger projects/harder concepts. Most of the techniques used here can be adapted for other applications as well.

## Let's get started!

This project will be broken up into 3 parts:
1. Obtaining the data (textbook)
2. Embedding the data
3. Querying the data

Overview. This is a high-level overview of the project. We'll go into more detail later.

## Obtaining the data

For this project, the data I needed was the raw text of my e-textbook. Unfortunately, **even though I paid for a ful license, Cengage still doesn't allow me to download the e-book**.

This was, by far, the hardest part of this project. But, I was able to find a workaround.

### Step 1: Gaining intel with developer tools

### Step 2: Testing the API with Postman

### Step 3: Scraping the data
