I originally built Semantics Cloud as the natural follow up to some of my early Natural Language Processing experiments. Once I'd started to use GPT-3 and other Large Language Models (LLMs) to help speed up my schoolwork, I needed a way to "train" a model to pull only from what I provide (and not its entire knowledge base). I started by reverse engineering [this](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb) OpenAI example, and then built out my own custom API. That evolved into a full-stack app that lets me upload any pdf and start to query it within a few seconds.

I'm not going to claim that this is anything revolutionary (it's just vector embeddings and GPT-3), but it does speed up my workflow, and it was a great way to grow my full-stack development skills.
