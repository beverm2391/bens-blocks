# Quizlet Generator using AI - A Step-by-Step Guide

## Problem: I got tired of manually creating flashcards.

I decided I'd rather have more time to study them how I wanted, rather than spend time creating them.

I'm a full time graduate student getting two masters degrees, so I don't have a lot of time to study. I'm also a software engineer, so I decided to use my skills to automate the process.

### I've actually been able to automate a significant portion of my homework

This is one of the first steps I took.
