# How to Use These Docs

Much of my Python code is written to be used in a [Jupyter Notebook]() environment. If you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, all you need to worry about is accessing [Google Colab](), a free (and the best) online Jupyter Notebook environment. No setup, no installation, no hassle.

## Steps
1. Copy the code
2. Figure out what it does
3. Adapt it to your project
4. Message me if you have any questions

## Where should I Start?

If you're already a developer, start with a project or a block.
If you're new to development in general, start with [Magic Concepts](/magic-concepts).
